### Contributing to this project

We welcome all contributions. Before submitting an issue, please read through currently open issues as well as the [Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md). Please note this is a work in progress, however we have attempted to document the limitations and caveats in the Roadmap and currently open issues.

We also ask that you be respectful in tone and language, and under no circumstances make inferences based on people's gender, race, nationality, etc. Please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Making Pull Requests

Even better than filing issues is making a Pull Request to fix something! We encourage you to try and fix things yourself and make Pull Requests, and we commit to being responsive and helpful while reviewing. When making a Pull Request, please make it against the `develop` branch in this repository. Where possible, please follow existing coding style practices - the only hard rule being please use spaces and not tabs for indentation, and the YAML files use 2 spaces for indents.

### Community

We are committed to running this as a community project, and highly encourage any involvement. Please reach out if you feel there's anything we can do to make this a more welcoming space for contributions - we really hope to collaborate with you to grow out this project!
